  args:
    # Example macro substitution map. Given this map, the processor will
    # perform the following operations:

    # Before translation starts (preprocessing): for every file with a '.sql'
    # extension, the strings '${MACRO_1}' and '%MACRO_2%' will be replaced
    # with 'macro_replacement_1' and 'macro_replacement_2', respectively. For
    # the file '2.sql', the processor will also replace 'templated_column' with
    # 'replacing_column'.

    # After translation finishes (post-processing): for every translated output
    # file the processor will reverse the aforementioned substitution.

    # Note that the processor just performs simple string replacement.
    # Collisions can happen if different macros are mapped to the same value.
